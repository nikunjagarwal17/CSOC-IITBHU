so reversearching the first image and looking a bit around i found this

trasnlating the name and searching for it

Searching on google i got to this site

where i found this 
> so its is conform that this location is Ankhor-Lokomotiv Park, Shaykhontohur Street 28, Tashkent, Toshkent Shahri, Uzbekistan


now looking for another image 

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/00c966d7-4eda-4d2f-9c98-f04b4cb031df)

here i found that it is  Chorsu Bazaar in Uzbekistan to confirm it further i checked some images on google maps which tends to me kind of similar to it
like 
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/27a9e5a4-8337-4070-b527-bf09971bd47f)
similar semicircular shape

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/fe87e2ac-5e97-4693-980b-214bc7d2ddc1)

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/a23b42cc-eb7f-4966-a672-0884c85fe7c7)


> similar kind of poles and the building in background so this confirms it to be **Chorsu Bazaar , Toshkent, Uzbekistan**

now before looking into other image let us first take look at the images and their names 
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/72363b84-c7df-4fa3-aee0-1578b06f1d96)

we know that the images or phots takes by a digital vamera or a mobile phone saves the iamges or videos in a sorted manner in which the images are taken looking into it we get that there is agap of 150 between the images takes very first and at very end.
also it in not a normal thing fir a person to take 150 images on a daily basis so most likely the man is travelling in another city or the country.

the first image taken is of **Chorsu Bazaar** and the next image that we are provided (but there are many photoss that we are not have access of) taken by the man is of **Ankhor-Lokomotiv Park** let mark these two sites on the map.

Considering that we the man is trvelling so that he may not have access to the personal transportation. there are most likely chances of tha person have taken taxi or by walking

> mode of trevelling is walking for the first two images.

now looking into the next image 

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/428ff025-dc7d-4103-9422-05873db5332c)

since the gap between this image and the previos image is only of 32 images so most likey the images are taken on the same day or the next day.

lets first get some points that we should notice 
- the image is taken from the middle of the road and there is some glare in the side of the images making it looks like the image is taken from a taxi while moving.
- since the next is a video so it is more likey that it is taken while going to the railway station.
- the road is not wet as that in the above two images make it looks like the image is more likely to to taken at next daty.
- moreover the sun is at the horizon make it looks like that is early morning or the eveing but in the next footage it is morning which is most likely to be taken just after reaching to the station.
-  there is snow all around so more likey the month is of january or febuary.
-  also we can see some big text eritten on the buildings like (samsung galaxy, navien and a big O which is incomplete although), a bus stop, with a underground station,
-  it is a cross way as we can see some vehicles at right most corner,

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/be032651-bd88-43f3-9f53-5102427a0ce8)

here is the railway station and many bus stops but few with our required configuration i.e. underground station, crossway. lookin around and shrinking down the list i found the station 
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/cd804959-5000-40b2-9d9e-62e54b128277)

looking all 3 found this at the location marked with green get some 3d street view got similar view
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/ee3128b3-91ee-43c3-b8d7-90b3dc9088a9)

clearly we can say its that location only.
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/3f950b11-e866-4536-869d-7798a470fb8c)

> location: 41.299358595716804, 69.27279559784523
>
> mode of traveling: taxi

also checkinf for the sunrize time in Toshkent will give us information about the time as the sun is just riseing i am using [suncalc](www.suncalc.org) for this purpose.
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/ec8b28b1-8bbd-465e-886e-e80070498821)

it is about 7:8 AM so most likely is that the man has taken his train between 7:30 - 8:30 so lets check for the trains at that time.

I am using this site to get out data.
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/8f0f380c-d583-4b56-bcb4-77f3798e0428)

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/46fdf952-0850-4e26-a50f-b17e600a3cf6)

these are the some places where the man can go 

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/2738c716-13f2-4bd6-9c12-6995881a14ca)

here I marked all the places where the man can go

we can clearly see that half of the stations are on the east and reast at the west If we can specity the direction the train is moving we can simply out work by reducing the number of stations to half.

for this lets look into the video footage that we got.

I am picking some intresting frames from the video from which we can get something helpful.


![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/90f96b48-ee37-49af-8978-0f215951f70d)

we got a paraller road running along the rail line, a small hut tpe structure, petrol pump, railway crossing,

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/e86210eb-df1e-48dd-a3e5-ab914277e92f)

there is one more railway station at the another side, the sun is on left top 

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/4adf03ea-00ee-4d5d-bc90-9b9fdbc2bea5)

trees are in ordered manner,

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/dfdf94a8-ec98-4663-8520-573dd03dc483)

shadow casted like this 

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/5af95ea9-2c69-4ac5-b665-7af3d83c6043)

nice horizontal lined pattern on the mountains.

and some type of residential area.

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/a24f689b-72c3-439e-bc67-afd35a3156d2)

we can clearly see that the train is moving toward west form east approximately.

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/4824261d-49ea-4ed0-99a3-64b6af8b73b9)

now we can discard the other stations and look for the remaining one.

lets check the rail routes 

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/bc8d1b84-e59d-45c3-be2b-7f71fe78bc09)
I got this map by a simple google search 
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/11fc58ca-84f0-46ff-b695-ae69b8171fb2)

there are only few parts where we are moving east to west lest check out these.

looking on the map 
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/59d6d928-a3ce-4412-8db0-b87903a7ed2f)

this area satisfies our requirements like mountains and moving east to west

further looking down we get 
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/a698be22-907a-4e8f-8a2a-d6ea6617122b)
arranged trees as we saw in video

lets looks more closer and get more details

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/a87bdb0c-7a0e-4813-b569-092c6cd6d3db)

got our two petrol pump opposite to each other and with a crossing and a road following the path

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/9c41936c-9b8b-4485-aabe-f9cccd869d66)
mountain with horizontal cuts on it 
now let mark down the starting point and ending point of the footage and calculate the distance

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/cef15816-f111-4ddc-bda1-c3649302920c)

here teh distance between the crossing with petrol pump to the mountain is .80 kms and time takes as seen in the video is 23 sec 
calculating the speed of the train 
> speed approximately 125 km/hr

now from here we we have to check for our final destination.

we have to move like one by one considering all the stations that are there one by one
![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/846056b4-c5d4-4467-a98c-069b4d191dee)

firstly we start with samarkand which is nearest of the all.

lets looks for the details in the picture we got

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/9bf8d57e-8d41-455f-9cfa-fa4b2c3e71a2)

- there is a reflection on the image which means the man is in a car (its a taxi as we can see the seat in the reflection and the man is sitting back of it)
- there is a bridge
- small hill type structure at the back
- a tower

the main attraction in out image is the bridge so lets search for bridges in the samarkand.

out of many bridges i am pointing out these tow as the are located around a hill type structure 

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/0a70bb62-f3aa-4fd4-ac90-de5cbbbebc74)

looking both of them

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/1b673859-2558-4486-bbca-e5cb03c2f284)

this looks more relavant as it has a big bridge going over the road with a power house also
lets take a look for street view


![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/8eeea181-169d-4df1-8efd-6a366f54e3ca)

it matches with our image i just highlightes the similar observation with the image.

so the final destination of the man is **samarkand**.
location of image 39.664742876406116, 66.98027401986884
