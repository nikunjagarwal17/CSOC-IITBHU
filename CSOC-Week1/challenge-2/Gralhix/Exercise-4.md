the name of the resort is **Oan resort**


b) What are the coordinates of the island?

since we know the name of the resort let try to get this on google map

here are the coordinates are 7째21'45.8"N 151째45'21.6"E


c) In which cardinal direction was the camera facing when the photo was taken?

now for this we may need a 3d model where we can go through it 
so using google earth and fixing the view accourding to the given photo we can adjust it accourding to the island visible in the foreground
on aligning I get like this

on the compass the direction looks something like **North-West**
