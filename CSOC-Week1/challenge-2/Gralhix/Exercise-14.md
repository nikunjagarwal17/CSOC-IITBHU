here are some results.
this leads us to some results about CHISINAU so maybe this video was of CHISINAU.

after searching on google i found this

so 
>  Magnitude: The earthquake had a magnitude of 5.8 degrees on the Richter scale.



so now for fing=ding the exact location of the camera we need to look all around the buildings and get where we are actaully at.
Until now we know that we are at CHISINAU,Moldova lets look into the recording and try to guess the buildings which they can be

![image](https://github.com/nikunjagarwal17/BanditOverTheWire/assets/144536875/f69150d6-c456-43d8-b04a-db83737ba9be)

here we can find some big buildings, although not much useful as there may can me tons of big buildings,
points to notice:
- curvy road
- a tall white buildings at the back.
- some smaller building with conical shape at top
- a building with a huge amount of lights opened at night and some small parking with it
- some area with lots of trees

not let us make some guesses and we will verify them, if they are ok then we are on right path else we will try to return and start with another guess.
lets start with that bil white building may be that one is some hotel or may be something else.
looking for the hotels I cannot get any of the maching results
lets come back to out guesses
now lets look for the huge lighting building 

the building is long, single floored, big lignthing comming from inside (may be having glass), opened at night (may be like grocerry store or other showrooms) but why the grocerry shop is opened at 2 am haha, may be the store of big things that can be seen from moving car(coz the glasses are installed at front) with a large enough parking, might the shop sells something big. with a heavy budget (open at night also with huge lights) looks like it is some sort of car dealership or may be something else.
lets check out

looking all and selecting out on based on points like curvy road and big building like things

looking in the car dealerships found something related **volvo car service**

matching with the collected points 
like conical top on a building 
bid white building
greeny area 
big buildings

lets dive more into it by checking into it

setting ut the camera angle with the footage

look something similar and the building under my curson is likely from where the footage is taken

so we are done
