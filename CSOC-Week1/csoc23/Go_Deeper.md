Extracting the file we got a audio file 
upon listening we found nothing also even got nothing form spectogram.
On reading the description carefull it some hint about **Deepsound** from the key word Deeper while this tool is only available for windows 

On extracting using the deepsound it asks us for the password well the password might be **kn1ght** 

Extracting the file using it as password we got our flag in a file flag.txt
